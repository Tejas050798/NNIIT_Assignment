# Smart Flashcard Backend

This is a backend project for a smart flashcard system. Users can add flashcards using just a question and answer. The system automatically detects the subject (like Physics, Biology, etc.) based on keywords in the question.

## Features

- Add flashcards without needing to choose a subject
- Automatically detects the subject (Physics, Biology, History, etc.)
- Students can retrieve a mixed set of flashcards from different subjects
- Flashcards are organized by each student

## How It Works

The backend checks for certain keywords in the question. Based on those keywords, it assigns a subject to the flashcard. All flashcards are stored in memory for the current session.
